# Demand Response

This page provides the detailed description reinforcement learning for demand response. For details about implementation of related functions please visit [RL Classes](../ReinforcementLearning/RLClasses.md).

## Overview
We build reinforcement learning based demand response for managing gas consumption in domestic households. We will use the model developed in flexibility identification to define a model-based RL agent that will learn to optimize the gas consumption of the household.
The state and action definitions will e defined using the thermal model of the household.
